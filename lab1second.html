  <p id="first-para">Study of Diabetes Prediction using Feature Selection and Classification1.Khyati K. Gandhi, 2.Prof. Nilesh B. Prajapati1.PG Student,Computer department,Birla Vishvakarma Mahavidhylaya, Vallabh Vidyanagar,India2.IT Department,Birla Vishvakarma Mahavidhylaya, Vallabh Vidyanagar,IndiaAbstract—Diabetesmellitus  is  one  of  the  most  serious  health challenges  in  both  developing  and  developed  countries.  It  has become leading cause of death. Detection of diabetes with optimal cost and better performance is the need of the age. Medical data are  multidimensional; hence  data  pre-processing  step  is  applied to  high  dimensional  data.  Feature  selection  is  a  pre-processing step that is applied to high dimensional dataset to reduce number of  dimensions  by  selecting  the  most  informative  features  that influence  the  diagnosis  of  the  disease.The  Pima  Indian  diabetic database  at  the  UCI  machine  learning  laboratory  has  become  a standard  dataset  for  testing  data  mining  algorithms  to  see  their prediction  accuracy  in  diabetes  data  classification.The  F-score feature   selection   method   and   k-means   clustering   select   the optimal feature subsets of the medical datasets that enhances the performance  of  the  Support  Vector  Machine  classifier.The performance of the SVM classifier is empirically evaluated on the reduced  feature  subset  ofDiabetes  dataset.  Then  performance  is validated  using  four  parameter </p>
